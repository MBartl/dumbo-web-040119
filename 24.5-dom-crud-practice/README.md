# Actual Deliverables
  As a user I want... 
  * to be able to click the button and add a taco emoji to the list
  * to be able to click any emoji and change it to a coconut 
    * including the bomb / poop / finger
    * and they should use the SAME callback as the tacos
  * to be able to right-click an emoji and delete it
    * including the bomb / poop / finger
    * and they should use the SAME callback as the tacos
  * to be able to click an emoji and cycle through ["🍩", "🌮", "🥥", "🍣"]
    * research HTML datasets for this and use them
  * Make the other button add a dolphin emoji
  * Get inputs from the form and add emojis that way
    * try to use
    * use .preventDefault
    * investigate how to get values from select and input (not innerText!!!)

# Gotchas
* What will happen if I += the innerHTML of an element with children that have event handlers?
